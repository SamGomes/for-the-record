“For the Record” is a collaborative game where a team of 3 musicians form a band. Their goal is to publish the maximum number of successful albums (mega-hits). 
Each round constitutes the creation and release of an album on the market.
In the first round of the game, each player starts by choosing the preferred instrument, which will be used in the creation of the albums.

Each player has two skills: the instrument and the marketing. The instrument skill is used during the creation of an album, while the marketing skill is used during the revenue phase. The two skills start at level 1. From the second round on, the player will be able to upgrade 
In the beginning of each new round (except the first one), each player can choose whether to improve the instrument skill or to improve the marketing skill by 1 point. By improving the instrument skill, the player increases the probability of the band to get a successful album. By improving the marketing, the player increases his/her individual probability to get more profit.

During the album creation, each musician will perform his/her instrument. The score of an album consists of summing the values each player achieved on his/her performance. The value of a performance is determined by rolling dice. A player can roll as many dice as his level on the instrument.

After created the album, the band has to release it on the market. The market value is evaluated by rolling 2 dice of 20 faces. If the market value is higher than the album score, that album is considered a "Fail". Conversely, if the market value is less or equal than the album score, that album is considered a "Mega-hit".
From the fourth round on, the band enters the international market, which means the market value is evaluated by rolling 3 dice of 20 faces (instead of the previous 2 dice). In other words, this increases the difficulty of achieving successful albums.

In case of a failed album, it gives no revenue to the band and each musician collects 0$.
In case of a mega-hit, the marketing proficiency of each musician determines his/her revenue, by rolling as many dice as his/her level on the marketing skill.

During the 5 rounds, if the band achieves 3 failed albums, the band collapses and the game is over.Conversely, if the band achieves less than 3 failed albums during the 5 rounds, the band succeeds with a victory.
